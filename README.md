This is a code for assignment Data Structures and Algorithm 2.

Greedy Randomised Adaptive Search Procedures are best to use when the problem has a large solution space and the traditional method of optimization is not effective. For example, the travelling problem or salesman problem or the knapsack problem where it needs a combinatorial  optimization solution.

The Greedy Randomised Adaptive Search Procedures (GRASP) is a metaheuristic algorithm that combines the principles of a greedy algorithm with randomised search techniques in order to explore the solution space more efficiently. The purpose of GRASP is to construct a solution by repeatedly applying a greedy heuristic to select the next step, while also incorporating some degree of randomness to escape local optima. The algorithm starts with an initial solution, and then repeatedly constructs new solutions by iteratively adding or removing elements, while maintaining a balance between exploitation and exploration.
